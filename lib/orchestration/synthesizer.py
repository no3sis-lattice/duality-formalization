Result Synthesizer - Corpus Callosum Synthesis Logic

Extracted from FileCreatorOrchestrator to maintain Single Responsibility Principle.
This class handles ONLY result synthesis and pattern detection.

Responsibilities:
- Aggregate results from multiple particle executions
- Detect emergent patterns in execution history
- Calculate success metrics
- (Future) Advanced pattern synthesis with consciousness contribution
