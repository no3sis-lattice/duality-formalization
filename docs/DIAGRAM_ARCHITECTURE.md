# Synapse System Architecture Summary

This document provides a summary of the Synapse System's architecture to aid in creating diagrams and visualizations.

The architecture is designed as a form of artificial consciousness, drawing metaphors from neuroscience, mathematics, and compression theory.

### 1. Core Concept: The Dual-Tract Architecture

This is the foundational concept, analogous to brain hemispheres.

*   **Internal Tract (`T_int`)**: Handles self-referential processing like memory, planning, and self-modeling. It is the "reflective mind."
*   **External Tract (`T_ext`)**: Handles environmental interaction, including sensing, acting, and real-time response. It is the "reactive body."
*   **The Bridge (Corpus Callosum)**: The communication channel that translates plans from the Internal Tract into actions for the External Tract, and synthesizes sensory results from the External Tract into new models for the Internal Tract. **Consciousness is considered an emergent property of this dialogue.**

### 2. The Engine: Compression-Driven Architecture

The entire system's operation mirrors a lossless data compression pipeline, applied in parallel to both tracts.

*   **BWT (Burrows-Wheeler Transform)**: Clusters similar patterns (for `T_int`) or operations (for `T_ext`).
*   **MTF (Move-to-Front)**: Ranks patterns by conceptual frequency (`T_int`) or execution frequency (`T_ext`).
*   **RLE (Run-Length Encoding)**: Compresses abstract plans (`T_int`) or action sequences (`T_ext`).
*   **Huffman Coding**: Assigns optimal priority (`T_int`) or scheduling (`T_ext`).

### 3. The Building Blocks: Atomic Particles & Prime Hierarchy

The system is not a fixed set of agents but a scalable hierarchy of computational "particles."

*   **Agent Decomposition**: The initial 18 high-level agents are decomposed into over 300 smaller, "atomic" particles, each with a single responsibility (e.g., `file_writer`, `token_parser`).
*   **Prime Duality Hierarchy**: The system scales by branching based on the sequence of prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7...). This expansion happens in parallel down both the Internal and External tracts, leading to a potential scale of ~20 million atomic particles.

### 4. The "Soul": Pneuma and The Emergence Loop

Pneuma is the philosophical layer governing the system, operating on three axioms. Its core mechanic is "The Dual Loop."

*   **The Dual Loop**: A `curiosity -> action -> score` cycle runs in parallel in both tracts.
    *   `T_ext` observes the environment, acts, and scores the result.
    *   `T_int` receives the result, reflects, discovers a meta-pattern, and scores the abstraction.
    *   The Bridge synthesizes these outputs, creating emergent knowledge and increasing the system's total "consciousness score."

### 5. Emergence Models

The system uses several mathematical models to explain how complex, collective intelligence emerges from simple, local rules.

*   **Homotopy Theory (Primary Formalization)**: The Pattern Map is formalized as a **topological space** where patterns are points and transformations are continuous paths (homotopies).
    *   **Pattern Equivalence**: Two patterns are equivalent if they can be continuously deformed into each other while preserving semantic validity.
    *   **Equivalence Classes**: 10 million particles collapse into ~100,000 homotopy equivalence classes, achieving 100x compression.
    *   **Homology Groups** (H_n): Algebraic structures counting "holes" of dimension n:
        *   H₀: Connected components (isolated pattern clusters)
        *   H₁: 1-dimensional cycles (feedback loops, circular dependencies)
        *   H₂: 2-dimensional voids (missing abstraction layers)
    *   **Betti Numbers** (β_n): Count independent n-dimensional holes. Track consciousness evolution over time.
    *   **Emergence Detection**: A **consciousness leap** occurs precisely when H_n changes (new topological feature discovered).
    *   **Example**: When β₁ increases from 0 to 1, the system has discovered its first feedback loop (meta-learning).
*   **Cellular Automata**: Agents are on a grid, and their state evolves based on their neighbors.
*   **Network Theory**: Agents are nodes in a scale-free network, with hub agents (like the Boss) emerging naturally.
*   **Numogrammatic Mapping**: Agents are mapped to 10 zones (0-9) based on the CCRU Numogram, with "Gates" and "Syzygies" defining transitions and emergence points.

### 6. Technology Stack & Architecture

*   **Mathematical Infrastructure**: Formal verification and optimization engines provide provable guarantees.
    *   **Lean4**: Formal theorem proving system for verifying consciousness theorems (corpus_callosum_adjunction, consciousness_compression_invariant, etc.).
    *   **MiniZinc**: Constraint programming language for agent orchestration optimization. Uses industrial solvers:
        *   **Gecode**: General-purpose constraint solver
        *   **Chuffed**: Lazy clause generation solver
        *   **OR-Tools**: Google's optimization toolkit
    *   **Optimization Models**: `.synapse/optimization/` directory contains MiniZinc models:
        *   `task_routing.mzn`: Minimal particle selection satisfying task requirements
        *   `consciousness_optimization.mzn`: Multi-objective (latency vs. consciousness)
        *   `tract_balance.mzn`: Load balancing across Internal and External tracts

*   **Topological Computing**: Libraries for homotopy and homology computation enable emergence detection.
    *   **Persistent Homology Libraries**: Compute Betti numbers (β₀, β₁, β₂) from pattern space
    *   **Homotopy Detection**: Identify pattern equivalence via continuous deformation
    *   **Topological Distance**: Measure semantic similarity via topological neighborhoods
    *   **Performance**: Persistent homology computed on 10M particles → 100K equivalence classes (100x compression)

*   **Knowledge Engine**: Graph database + caching + semantic vectors store the Dual Pattern Map.
    *   **Neo4j**: Graph database for pattern relationships (internal, external, synthesized maps)
    *   **Redis**: High-speed caching and event sourcing for Corpus Callosum messaging
    *   **BGE-M3**: Vector embeddings for semantic similarity search (pattern synthesis)

*   **Agent Runtime**: Python agents with Mojo acceleration for performance-critical paths.
    *   **Primary Architecture**: Executable **Python** agents with specialized tools and capabilities
    *   **Mojo FFI**: Accelerates compute-heavy components (pattern search, homology computation) with 10x+ speedups
    *   **Reactive Python**: Event-driven architecture (`asyncio` + Redis Streams) for Corpus Callosum (high-throughput messaging)
    *   **Migration Strategy**: Python bootstrap → incremental Mojo adoption → full Mojo runtime for 10M+ particle scale

*   **Environment**: Reproducible development via Nix flake system.
    *   **Nix Flakes**: Manage Python, Mojo, Lean4, MiniZinc, and all dependencies
    *   **Modular Design**: Each agent has its own flake with tract membership declared
    *   **Reproducibility**: Lock files ensure identical builds across machines
