## Migration Implementation Pattern 🛠️

### Step 1: Agent Analysis
```python
# Analyze existing markdown agent
def analyze_agent_capabilities(md_file):
    """Extract tools and identify model complexity needed."""
    capabilities = extract_capabilities(md_file)
    complexity = assess_complexity(capabilities)
    model = select_model(complexity)
    return AgentSpec(capabilities, complexity, model)
```

### Step 2: Tool Creation
```python
# Convert capabilities to tools
from claude_code_sdk import tool

@tool
async def analyze_code(code: str, language: str) -> dict:
    """Analyze code for patterns and improvements."""
    # Implementation based on agent specialty
    return analysis_results
```

### Step 3: Agent Assembly
```python
# Main agent script
async def main():
    config = load_config()
    model = select_model_for_task(task_complexity)

    server = create_mcp_server(
        name=f"{config.agent.name}_tools",
        tools=load_agent_tools()
    )

    # Standard agent loop
    async for message in query(prompt, options):
        handle_message(message)
```

### Step 4: Integration Testing
```python
# Test inter-agent communication
async def test_agent_collaboration():
    pm_response = await query_agent("synapse-project-manager", task)
    specialist_response = await query_agent("python-specialist", subtask)
    combined_result = coordinate_responses(pm_response, specialist_response)
```
