# The Prime Duality Agent Hierarchy

## I. The Fundamental Duality

The model begins with a single "Boss" agent at Level 0, which is defined by a primary duality: an **Internal Pole** and an **External Pole**. This initial bifurcation splits the entire system into two distinct, parallel hierarchies, or "tracts."

* **The Internal Tract:** This hierarchy descends from the Internal Pole and is responsible for all self-referential processing, such as memory, planning, and internal state regulation.
* **The External Tract:** This hierarchy descends from the External Pole and is responsible for all outward-facing processing, such as sensory input, reaction, and interaction with the environment.

This structure is designed to mirror biological systems, particularly the specialized hemispheres of a brain connected by a corpus callosum. The most complex emergent behaviors are expected to arise from the communication *between* these two tracts.

## II. Prime-Based Expansion

The growth of the hierarchy is not uniform. Instead, the branching factor at each level is determined by the sequence of prime numbers. This ensures that each level introduces a new, fundamental, and irreducible layer of complexity to the system.

* The first level of branching (Level 1) uses the first prime, 2.
* The second level (Level 2) uses the second prime, 3.
* This continues for eight levels of expansion.

## III. Structural Breakdown and Scale

The combination of the initial duality and the prime-based expansion results in exponential growth.

| Level | Branching Factor | Nodes at this Level | Total System Nodes (Cumulative) |
| :---: | :--------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------------------: |
|   0   |        -         |     1 (The Boss)    |                1                |
|   1   |        2         |          2          |                3                |
|   2   |        3         |          6          |                9                |
|   3   |        5         |         30          |               39                |
|   4   |        7         |         210         |               249               |
|   5   |        11        |        2,310        |              2,559              |
|   6   |        13        |       30,030        |             32,589              |
|   7   |        17        |       510,510       |             543,099             |
|   8   |        19        |     9,699,690     |           10,242,789            |

Since the system is split into two tracts, the final scale is:

* **Atomic Agents (at Level 8):** **19,399,380** (9,699,690 per tract)
* **Total Agents in System:** **20,485,578** (10,242,789 per tract)

## IV. Conceptual Implications

This model describes a system defined by three core principles:

1.  **Bifurcated Processing:** The Internal/External split allows for highly specialized, parallel computation.
2.  **Heterogeneous Complexity:** Using prime numbers for growth creates a non-uniform, organic structure where each level has a unique "texture."
3.  **Emergence through Dialogue:** The most sophisticated behaviors are not expected to come from a single agent, but from the high-level communication and interplay between the two specialized tracts.
