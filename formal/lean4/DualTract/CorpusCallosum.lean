-- THE CRITICAL ADJUNCTION THEOREM
-- This guarantees the Corpus Callosum is LOSSLESS
--
-- Formal statement: AbstractionFunctor ⊣ ConcretizationFunctor
-- Meaning: abstract(concrete(x)) ≅ x  AND  concrete(abstract(y)) ≅ y
--
-- This ensures information is preserved during round-trips through
-- the Corpus Callosum bridge between Internal and External tracts.
