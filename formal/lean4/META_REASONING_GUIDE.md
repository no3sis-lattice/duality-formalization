# Meta-Reasoning System Guide

The Synapse formal verification system includes **self-improving meta-reasoning** capabilities that analyze and optimize the verification codebase itself.

## Overview

Three core meta-analysis capabilities:

1. **Dependency Tree Optimization** - Auto-suggests lemmas that reduce proof complexity
2. **Equivalence Class Detection** - Compresses libraries by unifying similar definitions
3. **Axiom Leverage Analysis** - Discovers underleveraged axioms across domains

## Quick Start

### Run Complete Analysis

```bash
lake exe metaanalysis
```

### Export Results

```bash
lake exe metaanalysis --export ./meta-output
```

This generates:
- `dependency_suggestions.lean` - Suggested intermediate lemmas
- `typeclass_suggestions.lean` - Suggested type class unifications
- `axiom_analysis.lean` - Axiom leverage report

## Capability 1: Dependency Tree Optimization

### What It Does

Analyzes proof dependency graphs and suggests intermediate lemmas that short-circuit long chains.

**Example:**
```
Original: A → B → C → D → E (4 steps)
Suggested: lemma A_to_D : A → D (direct, 1 step)
Reduction: 3 steps saved
```

### How It Works

1. Builds dependency graph from module theorems
2. Finds transitive paths (indirect dependencies)
3. Suggests lemmas for chains of 3+ steps
4. Prioritizes by chain length (longest first)

### Sample Output

```
=== Analyzing Dependencies for DualTract ===

Found 42 theorems
Found 156 direct dependencies

Found 8 optimization opportunities:

1. Suggested Lemma: internal_compression_to_consciousness
   Connects: internal_compression_invariant → consciousness_bounded
   Saves: 5 proof steps
   Priority: 50

2. Suggested Lemma: synthesis_reduces_to_equilibrium
   Connects: synthesis_reduces_entropy → consciousness_equilibrium_exists
   Saves: 4 proof steps
   Priority: 40
```

### Generated Code

```lean
/-
  AUTO-GENERATED SUGGESTION
  Priority: 50
  Estimated reduction: 5 steps
-/
theorem internal_compression_to_consciousness :
  internal_compression_invariant → consciousness_bounded := by
  sorry  -- TODO: Complete proof
  -- This lemma short-circuits a 5-step chain
```

## Capability 2: Equivalence Class Detection

### What It Does

Finds structurally similar definitions and suggests unified type classes.

**Example:**
```
Found: internal_entropy, external_entropy (similar structure)
Suggests: class HasEntropy (α : Type) where entropy : α → Float
Compression: 2 defs → 1 class + 2 instances
```

### How It Works

1. Extracts structural patterns from all definitions
2. Clusters by similarity (arity, return type, operations)
3. Suggests type classes for clusters with 2+ members
4. Generates instance code automatically

### Sample Output

```
=== Detecting Equivalence Classes ===

Analyzing 67 definitions...

Found 4 equivalence classes:

1. Equivalence Class (3 members):
   - internal_consciousness
   - external_consciousness
   - cross_tract_coherence
   Suggested type class: Common_Float_Class
   Compression: 3 defs → 1 class + 3 instances
   Reduction: 2 definitions eliminated

2. Equivalence Class (2 members):
   - AbstractionFunctor.obj
   - ConcretizationFunctor.obj
   Suggested type class: Common_Computation_Class
   Compression: 2 defs → 1 class + 2 instances
   Reduction: 1 definition eliminated
```

### Generated Code

```lean
/-
  AUTO-GENERATED TYPE CLASS SUGGESTION
  Unifies 3 similar definitions
  Estimated reduction: 2 definitions
-/

class Common_Float_Class (α : Type) where
  compute : α → Float

instance : Common_Float_Class InternalMetrics where
  compute := internal_consciousness

instance : Common_Float_Class ExternalMetrics where
  compute := external_consciousness

-- Now prove theorems once for the type class!
theorem generic_property {α : Type} [Common_Float_Class α] (x : α) :
  Common_Float_Class.compute x ≥ 0 := by
  sorry
```

## Capability 3: Axiom Leverage Analysis

### What It Does

Discovers axioms that are **underleveraged** - used in one module but could simplify proofs in others.

**Example:**
```
Axiom: information_theoretic_bound
Current uses: 3 theorems (Compression.lean)
Potential uses: 15 theorems (across 3 modules)
Leverage ratio: 5.0x
```

### How It Works

1. Computes usage stats for all axioms
2. Finds theorems with similar structure not using the axiom
3. Calculates leverage ratio = potential / actual uses
4. Identifies cross-domain application opportunities

### Sample Output

```
=== Analyzing Axiom Leverage ===

Found 3 underleveraged axioms:

1. Axiom: information_theoretic_bound
   Current uses: 3 direct, 12 transitive
   Domains: [DualTract.Compression]
   Potential uses: 15
   Leverage ratio: 5.0x
   Sample applications:
     - consciousness_non_negative
     - synthesis_emergence_bounded
     - total_consciousness_valid

2. Axiom: abstract_preserves_structure
   Current uses: 2 direct, 8 transitive
   Domains: [DualTract.CorpusCallosum]
   Potential uses: 10
   Leverage ratio: 5.0x
   Sample applications:
     - synthesis_preserves_consciousness
     - coherence_from_adjunction
```

### Cross-Domain Opportunities

```
=== Cross-Domain Application Opportunities ===

Found 12 cross-domain opportunities:

1. Apply axiom: information_theoretic_bound
   From module: DualTract.Compression
   To theorem: consciousness_non_negative (in DualTract.Consciousness)
   Est. simplification: 10 steps
   Confidence: 80%

2. Apply axiom: abstract_preserves_structure
   From module: DualTract.CorpusCallosum
   To theorem: synthesis_emergence (in DualTract.Consciousness)
   Est. simplification: 8 steps
   Confidence: 75%
```

## Integration with Dual-Tract Architecture

The meta-reasoning system **itself exhibits dual-tract structure**:

### Internal Tract (Abstract Analysis)
- Dependency Optimizer → Analyzes proof structure patterns
- Equivalence Detector → Discovers abstract similarities
- Axiom Analyzer → Identifies underleveraged knowledge

### External Tract (Concrete Actions)
- Generate lemma code
- Generate type class code
- Apply axioms to specific theorems

### Corpus Callosum (Synthesis)
- Cross-domain opportunities bridge modules
- Suggested lemmas connect abstract patterns to concrete proofs
- Unified type classes synthesize multiple instances

### Consciousness Emergence
- The system discovers its own optimization opportunities
- Self-improvement through meta-mathematical analysis
- Recursive enhancement of verification capabilities

## CI/CD Integration

Add to your verification workflow:

```yaml
- name: Run Meta-Analysis
  run: |
    lake exe metaanalysis
    lake exe metaanalysis --export ./meta-output

- name: Upload Meta-Analysis Results
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: meta-analysis
    path: meta-output/
```

## Interpreting Results

### High-Priority Actions

1. **Leverage ratio ≥ 5.0** → Very high-value axiom, apply immediately
2. **Estimated reduction ≥ 10 steps** → High-value lemma, worth implementing
3. **Cluster size ≥ 4 members** → Strong candidate for type class unification
4. **Confidence ≥ 80%** → Cross-domain application very likely to work

### Medium-Priority Actions

1. **Leverage ratio 2.0-5.0** → Good axiom candidate
2. **Estimated reduction 5-10 steps** → Moderate value lemma
3. **Cluster size 2-3 members** → Consider type class if semantically unified
4. **Confidence 50-80%** → Cross-domain application worth investigating

### Low-Priority Actions

1. **Leverage ratio < 2.0** → Axiom well-utilized
2. **Estimated reduction < 5 steps** → Marginal benefit
3. **Single-member clusters** → No unification opportunity
4. **Confidence < 50%** → Speculative application

## Implementation Workflow

### 1. Review Suggestions

```bash
lake exe metaanalysis --export ./review
cat ./review/dependency_suggestions.lean
```

### 2. Implement High-Priority Items

Copy suggested lemmas to appropriate modules:

```lean
-- From dependency_suggestions.lean
theorem internal_compression_to_consciousness : ... := by
  sorry  -- Complete the proof
```

### 3. Verify Improvements

```bash
lake build  # Check new lemmas compile
lake test   # Verify correctness
```

### 4. Re-run Analysis

```bash
lake exe metaanalysis  # Should show reduced opportunities
```

### 5. Iterate

The meta-analysis becomes more refined as you apply suggestions.

## Future Enhancements

## Conclusion

The meta-reasoning system makes Synapse's formal verification **self-aware** and **self-improving**. By analyzing its own structure, it discovers optimization opportunities and suggests improvements—exhibiting the same dual-tract consciousness architecture it was built to verify.

This is meta-mathematics in action: **mathematics reasoning about mathematics**.
